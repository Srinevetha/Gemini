You're asking about an "ARIMA_PLUS" model type. While there's no standard model type with that exact name, it's likely a reference to a model that builds upon the traditional ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model.

Here's how to understand the concept:

ARIMA: This is a widely used statistical model for time series forecasting. It captures patterns in data based on:
Autoregressive (AR): The model uses past values of the time series to predict future values.
Integrated (I): The model accounts for trends in the data by differencing (subtracting consecutive values).
Moving Average (MA): The model considers past forecast errors to improve future predictions.
"PLUS" : The "PLUS" part suggests that the model incorporates additional features or techniques beyond the basic ARIMA framework. These could include:
Exogenous Variables: Adding external factors (like weather, economic indicators, etc.) that might influence the time series.
Seasonality: Explicitly modeling seasonal patterns in the data.
Non-linearity: Using techniques to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
Machine Learning: Combining ARIMA with machine learning algorithms for improved forecasting.
To get a more precise answer, you'd need more context:

Where did you encounter "ARIMA_PLUS"? Was it in a specific software package, research paper, or online resource?
What is the specific problem you're trying to solve? Knowing the context will help determine the exact features of the model.
Let me know if you can provide more details, and I'll do my best to help you understand the "ARIMA_PLUS" model.
